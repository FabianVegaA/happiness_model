# Happiness Model

This is an API Rest that uses an ML model to make prediction of the happiness score of a country.

## Model
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, its name is The World Happiness and you can look it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness). The dataset is split in a lot of years from 2015 until 2019 in `.csv` files. Before fitting the model these files are transformed. Mainly, merging the firsts 3 files and changing its columns can use a dataset with more data.  

This project was built with Python using the library [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). For obtain the best model, I use the method from sklearn, [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html), this allow test a serie of configurations and ML models, in this case the models:
- SVR
- GradientBoostingRegressor

With the next configurations:
``` Python
self.params = {
            'SVR': {
                'kernel': ['linear', 'poly', 'rbf'],
                'gamma': ['auto', 'scale'],
                'C': [1, 5, 10],
            },
            'GRADIENT': {
                'loss': ['ls', 'lad'],
                'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.05, 0.1],
            },
        }
```

## API Rest
For API was used Flask and Boostrap to the styles and the HTML.

For use the model you must import a file previously created by `main.py`. In this way, the user can tester different parameters to have a prediction of the model.
